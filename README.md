# Tauri Plugin Persisted Scope
![Test](https://github.com/tauri-apps/tauri-plugin-persisted-scope/workflows/Test/badge.svg)

This plugin provides a Tauri Plugin that saves the filesystem and asset scopes and restores it when the app is reopened.

## Installation
There are three general methods of installation that we can recommend.
1. Pull sources directly from Github using git tags / revision hashes (most secure, good for developement, shown below)
2. Git submodule install this repo in your tauri project and then use `file` protocol to ingest the source
3. Use crates.io and npm (easiest, and requires you to trust that our publishing pipeline worked)

For more details and usage see [the vanilla demo](examples/vanilla/src-tauri/src/main.rs).
Please note, below in the dependencies you can also lock to a revision/tag in the `Cargo.toml`.

`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`
```yaml
[dependencies]
tauri = "1.0"
tauri-plugin-persisted-scope = "0.1"
```

Use in `src-tauri/src/main.rs`:
```rust
fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_persisted_scope::init())
        .run();
}
```
